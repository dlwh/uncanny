    variety of metrics.  We model linguistic areas by a Pitman-Yor

    A standard form of analysis for linguistic typology is the universal
    implication.  These implications state facts about the range of extant
    languages, such as ``if objects come after verbs, then adjectives come
    after nouns.''  Such implications are typically discovered by
    painstaking hand analysis over a small sample of languages.  We
    propose a computational model for assisting at this process.  Our
    model is able to discover both well-known implications as well as some
    novel implications that deserve further study.  Moreover, through a
    careful application of hierarchical analysis, we are able to cope with
    the well-known sampling problem: languages are not independent.
